# 📊 Time Series Stock Market Forecasting

This project focuses on predicting stock market trends using time series analysis techniques. The goal is to forecast future stock prices using historical data and compare the performance of different time series forecasting models.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Analyze and visualize historical stock market data.
- Perform time series decomposition and stationarity checks.
- Build forecasting models using:
  - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
  - ARIMA
  - Facebook Prophet
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory – Deep Learning)
- Evaluate model accuracy and forecast future prices.

## 📁 Files Included

- `notebook.ipynb` – Main notebook containing data preprocessing, modeling, and forecasting.
- `cleaned_aapl_data.csv` – Cleaned Apple stock dataset used for modeling.
- `README.md` – Project description and usage guide.
- `requirements.txt` – Python libraries required to run this project.

## 📈 Models Compared
